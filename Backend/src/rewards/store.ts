/**
 * Reward persistence, claim state machine, and status reads.
 *
 * Issues #656 and #657.
 *
 * The claim flow is the delicate part. A payout is money leaving the system, so
 * the invariants are stated explicitly and enforced in the database rather than
 * in application code that a second code path could forget:
 *
 *   - **No double-claim.** Accruals are claimed under `FOR UPDATE`, so two
 *     concurrent claims of the same rows serialise; the second sees them already
 *     claimed and claims nothing. Without the row lock, two requests arriving
 *     together would both read "claimable" and both pay out.
 *   - **A claim is idempotent by key.** The caller supplies an idempotency key;
 *     replaying the same request returns the original claim rather than moving
 *     money again. This matters because a network retry is indistinguishable
 *     from a new request, and only the caller can tell them apart.
 *   - **A failed payout returns the accruals.** `processing` is a real state,
 *     not a formality: a claim that is in flight holds its accruals, and a
 *     failure releases them. A crash mid-payout therefore leaves the money
 *     `processing` and visible as such, rather than lost or double-paid.
 *
 * Balances are always derived from the accrual rows, never stored as a running
 * total. A cached balance and its underlying lines disagreeing is the classic
 * accounting bug; deriving the sum means they cannot.
