/**
 * Request ID propagation (#684).
 *
 * The API already generated a correlation id for inbound requests, but it was
 * only echoed by three routes, was not accepted under a standard header name,
 * and was never attached to the outbound calls the backend makes. That made a
 * request impossible to follow once it left the HTTP handler.
 *
 * This module is the single place that decides:
 *   - where an inbound request id comes from (`X-Request-Id`, falling back to
 *     the legacy `X-Correlation-Id`) and how one is generated when absent;
 *   - how it reaches handlers (`req.requestId`, with `req.correlationId` kept
 *     as a back-compat alias) and logs (`getRequestId()`);
 *   - how it is returned to the caller (`X-Request-Id` + `X-Correlation-Id` on
 *     every response, success or error);
 *   - how it is copied onto outbound service calls
 *     (`outboundRequestHeaders()`).
 *
 * No new framework or dependency is involved: the id is bound to the request
 * with the built-in `AsyncLocalStorage` so non-HTTP code can read the id of the
 * call it is serving without threading it through every signature.
